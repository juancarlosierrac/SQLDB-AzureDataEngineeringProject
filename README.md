# **SQL Database - Azure Data Engineering Project**

## **Introduction**
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data engineering pipeline using Microsoft Azure. It is designed to extract, transform, and analyze data from an on-premises SQL database to generate business insights.  

---

## **Project Overview**
The project extracts data from the AdventureWorks database, processes it using Azure Data Factory and Azure Databricks, and loads it into Azure Synapse Analytics. Finally, the data is visualized through Power BI for business analysis.
